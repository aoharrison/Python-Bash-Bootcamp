    "# List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are (mostly) used to create new lists from iterables or ranges.  They are enclosed by square brackets, contain the keywords `for` and `in`, and may contain a conditional statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Noticing that this is just another way to iterate over a list to create a new one, you may be asking, why not just use a for loop?  The short answer is that they are more Pythonic (real world), which in essence means that it's the way things are done in python.  The longer answer is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> List comprehensions are also more declarative than loops, which means theyâ€™re easier to read and understand. Loops require you to focus on how the list is created. You have to manually create an empty list, loop over the elements, and add each of them to the end of the list. With a list comprehension in Python, you can instead focus on what you want to go in the list and trust that Python will take care of how the list construction takes place.\n",
